📌 PROBLEM STATEMENT

Over 582,000 Americans experience homelessness on any given night, facing severe health challenges such as:
Communicable diseases

Mobility limitations
Lack of preventive care
The Need: A solution to bridge the healthcare gap by providing accessible, affordable, and timely medical support to improve health outcomes for this vulnerable population.

💡 SOLUTION

Connect homeless individuals with nearby hospitals based on affordability.
Symptom-based matching with appropriate healthcare departments.
Facilitate blood tests to aid diagnosis and ensure timely treatment.
This solution reduces barriers to healthcare, lowers health risks, and provides timely care to improve the overall well-being of the homeless population.
